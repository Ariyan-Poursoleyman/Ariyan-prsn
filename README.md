# Hi there, I'm Ariyan Poursoliman ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ¯ I'm an entry-level Android Developer with a strong drive to learn, build, and grow in the world of mobile development.  
While I'm still early in my Android journey, Iâ€™m fully committed to writing clean, functional code and continuously improving my skills through practice and real-world projects.

Currently working as a **Senior Implementation Expert** (since 3 years), I've contributed to more than 100 projects and actively participate in **R&D sessions** to improve solutions and align with client requirements.

- Android app development using **Kotlin**  
- Comfortable with **Java** and Android SDK basics  
- Applying **MVVM** and **MVP** architectures in small projects  
- Using **Room ORM** and **Coroutines**  
- UI design with **XML**

## ðŸŒ± What drives me

I'm not an expert yet â€” but Iâ€™m serious about becoming one.
